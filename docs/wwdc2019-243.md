-   Apps 'donate' events to Siri via [SiriKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit)
-   If your app supports "Check-in" you get a balloon on the home screen
-   Donating: `INInteraction(...)`
-   AppDelegate handler for Intent
-   Donations that are updates of earlier items, and done in the
    background will not trigger a donation notification
-   Donate when the details are being shown, otherwise the Siri
    notifications that happen with the donation seem out of context.

Remarks:
-   **Don't recommend watching**: very slow very low information density,
    instead just use [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit),
    or attached demo materials.
