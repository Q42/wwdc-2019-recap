-   Use UIHostingController
-   NSHostingController/NSHostingView
-   Use @IBSegueAction + UIHostingController to push a segue to a
    swiftui view

-   UIViewRepresentable
-   UIViewControllerRepresentable

A Coordinator object can be used to wrap a binding to make target/action
work with UIKit views.
