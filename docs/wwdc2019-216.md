- Views are nice, but how do you: cloud sync, drag & drop?
- Bindings, `@State` attribute, see also "Data Flow through Swift UI"
- Forms, like VStack but for heterogeneous views
- VStack =\> Form, is a drop-in replacement, renders like Settings app
- `Section { ... }` for grouping of views (with optionally section titles)
- Parent view customizes subview properties: the items inside Form are rendered differently than inside VStack. This uses the 'environment' to attach root styles at the Form level.

### SwiftUI Labs
Right after, we went to the labs:

- `UITableView`-like performance will come in future releases, the
  current `List` is less performant.
- Data Bindings how-to

- [More backends coming?](https://twitter.com/hermanbanken/status/1136371582656425986)
- For `UITableView` prefetching: use `.OnAppear` and `.OnDisappear`
