1. Layout System, by [Dave Abraham](https://twitter.com/daveabrahams)
    - > “Layout is about determining the bounds of what you see on the screen”
    - Root View -> Content View -> Text, root view is already minus the safe area insets
    - Modifier: `.edgesIgnoreingSafeArea(true)`
    - Parent proposes size for a child, but child chooses its own size
    - Modifiers: `.aspectRatio(1)`, `.frame(width: height:)`
    - SwiftUI rounds to nearest pixel
    - `.padding()` uses adaptive padding, automatically resizes padding depending on environment
    - By default, Image’s are fixed size
    - Adaptive Spacing & Edge to Edge spacing adheres to Human Interface Design Guidelines
    - How Stacks work: walkthrough about how the child sizes are calculated
    - `.layoutPriority(1)`, default priority is 0. Children are examined in layout priority order.
    - Alignments include `.lastTextBaseline` which align all text baselines to the bottom (ict `.bottom`)
    - `aligmentGuide(<.alignment>) { d in d[.bottom] * 0.98 }`
    - Custom ‘AlignmentID’ for deep nested subview alignment.

2. Custom Views, by [John Harper](https://twitter.com/jsh8080)
    - Demo code of creating a colorwheel
    - Custom Shapes: adhere to `Shape { func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path, optional var animatableData: AnimatableData }`
    - Modifier: `.tapAction { … }`
    - Custom Transisitions (scaleAndFade shown in demo)
    - Uses `ViewModifier { func body(content: Content) -> some View }`
    - `let transition = AnyTransition.modifier(active: modifier identity: modifier)`
    - `.drawingGroup()` draws everything with Metal on GPU in CALayer

Questions we had:
1. Does `.drawingGroup` work for everything? What are the downsides, or why not use it everywhere:
  [Twitter answer](https://twitter.com/hermanbanken/status/1137040926386184192):
  "Yeah, the only restriction should be that native views in the drawing group won’t render: they’ll draw a placeholder instead to show the error [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/3278548-drawinggroup)"

Notes:
1. How to creating custom alignments (like in a Grid view), is explained here. You might even be able to hack together a UICollectionView-alternative for SwiftUI.

----------------


Tip: .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all) modifier to ignore safe area

The parent view proposes a size for its child, but a child view always
chooses its own size, the parent cannot force that.

Next, the parent places the child in the parent's coordinate space.
Coordinates are rounded off to the nearest pixel.

"Focus on the things that make your app special." Also, avocado toast.

.padding(\[edges\]) gives you adaptive padding by default.

Modifiers always return a new view. So padding is a view.

Images are fixed size unless you mark them as resizable

.layoutPriority(n)

Defining a new vertical alignment:

        enum Foo: AlignmentID {

                static func defaultValue...

        }

### Custom Views

Use the Shape protocol, the only requirement is path(in rect:).

Implement animatableData to animate it.

ZStack stacks views on top of each other.

protocol ViewModifier

        Applies changes to another view

.drawingGroup() flattens all the SwiftUI views in a single one and
renders it with metal. This only works if the child views are Shapes.
For UIKit controls it won't work.
