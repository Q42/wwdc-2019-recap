1.  Bonjour

    -   Wide-Area Service Discovery: discover printers in different network, via "Discovery Proxy" ([https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/mDNSResponder](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/mDNSResponder&sa=D&ust=1559981348864000))
    -   NWBrowser is a new Bonjour service discovery helper
    -   TLS with symmetric keys using a passphrase & CryptoKit demo'd in the TicTacToe application

2.  Building Framing Protocols

    -   You can now write Framing logic that runs in the Networking User
        Thread
    -   Implement NWProtocolFramerImplementation, handleInput, handleOutput
    -   Add custom protocol to parameters.applicationProtocols

3.  Collecting Metrics

    -   URLSession Task Metrics is improved
    -   Available in didFinishCollectingMetrics call of URLSession
    -   Network.framework Metrics now allows inspecting metrics of
        individual network calls
    -   'Optimistic DNS' optimistically connects to last known server of
        DNS. In parallel performs a DNS lookup & disconnects initial
    -   Devices&Simulators now has Device Conditions (for example Network
        Link which can be set to 3G, WiFi or High Latency DNS)

4.  Best Practices and Status Updates (by Stuart Cheshire)

    -   Catalyst apps have by default only access for Outgoing applications
    -   TLS 1.3 is now supported. Much faster (1 roundtrip instead of 2) and more secure (AEDE & Forward Secrecy)
    -   Access to network information is now restricted to select apps,
        current VPN apps & NEHotspotConfiguration apps
    -   Use the Network Link Conditioner in Xcode tool Devices&Simulators
    -   allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess, waitsForConnectivity = true
    -   file:// and ftp:// are no longer available
    -   SPDY is replaced by HTTP/2
    -   '\_tcp.\_tictactoe' Bonjour service is actually registered with IANA ðŸ¤£
    -   Apple team won the ACM award for great networking achievements for
        multi-path TCP today
