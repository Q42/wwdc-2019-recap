- The `.swiftmodule` file inside modules now is `.swiftinterface` so it contains only interfaces, no implementations
- Shared runtime for compatible OS’ses. App Store thins the runtime copy away if the bundle is build for older OS’ses too.
- 10% smaller code size with Swift 5.1 due to optimizations
- 15x faster String -\> NSString bridging between Objective-C/Swift due to using UTF-8 instead of UTF-16
- Dockerized Swift available on DockerHub
- soucekitd stress tests
- LSP: [apple/sourcekit-lsp](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) for source code completions in vim/vscode/etc.
- String interpolation with “LocalizedStringKey”: translation AFTER the translation is done.
  [see SE-0228](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0228-fix-expressiblebystringinterpolation.md)
- Opaque Result Types: `some Shape`
    - Mitigates 4 downsides of returning the root Protocol type
    - Equality checks
    - Compiler optimizations, etc.
- `@propertyWrapper` to declare & access
