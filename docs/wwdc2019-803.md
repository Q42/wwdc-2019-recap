Very high level talk about ML experiences, good watch for customers wanting to use ML.
Good watch for Interaction Designers.

-   > "Design more than just the interface"
-   Outputs: multiple options (all results from confidence list result),
    attributes (how does the app decide?), confidence (how sure?),
    limitations
-   State real facts in attributions "Top Picks, because you love
    cooking" =\> "Top Picks, because you downloaded NY Cooking"
-   Convert confidence levels into easy to understand information /
    actions.
-   Use 'ranges' for confidence effect (you'll arrive between
    13:10-13:20)
-   Coaching tips like with Animoji: "Low Light", "Camera Covered"
-   Limitation with alternatives in macOS: "Set a timer for 20 minutes."
    "Sorry, can't set a timer, how about a reminder?"
-   BasketBall ML app uses neat calibration setup: auto detects basket &
    starts keeping the score
-   Implicit Feedback, used in for example Siri Suggestions
-   Explicit Feedback: buttons like/dislike are unclear what action will
    follow. "Show less from this Author" is more specific.
-   Corrections: fixing mistake, example in Keyboard. When you type a
    name, correct the suggestion, then the Keyboard learns
-   In Photos app, the auto-correct rotation & crop result will only be
    the starting point of your action. You can then tweak it.

-----------------------


All kinds of features use ML, such as the airpods, the keyboard,
photos\...

Example: photos categorizes the photos based on what's in them.

It takes more than just the \[user\] interface. Think about the
information design.

We have to design the model and its interface.

[![](images/image3.jpg)]{style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 370.00px; height: 439.66px;"}

Evaluation
----------

### Data

Lots of training data is crucial to get a good result.

Data needs to be designed.

Collect data intentionally.Â Data biases are lurking. Example: for face
recognition, collect data of all races and types of users. For an app
that's used outdoors, collect data from outdoors.

Optimize for the customers you want. Don't reflect the world, but create
for the world how you want it to be.

Test your app for biases.

Update data as product specifications change.

Beware of standard (academic) data sets, as these often don't represent
real experiences.

### Metrics

Evaluate your model. Design metrics to evaluate it. The metrics should
define if an experience is good. Your metrics reflect your values.

Inform users about the metrics, for example in Face ID: 1 in 1000000
chance of a stranger unlocking your device. Give it meaning to them.

Interface patterns
------------------

### Outputs

-   Multiple options



-   Choose from the results a feature generates
-   Provide a set of meaningfully different options, such as different
    routes in a navigation app.



-   Attributions



-   Avoid profiling people
-   State real facts, instead of "Top picks because you love cooking",
    say "Top picks because you love \$appName"
-   Cite the data source



-   Confidence -\> certainty measure



-   Translate into human terms instead of displaying just raw
    numbers/percentages
-   Provide a range in case of an estimation
-   



-   Limitations



-   Limitations happen when there's a mismatch between people's mental
    model of the feature and of what the feature actually does.
-   Guide people past limitations. Example: memoji. A tip is shown when
    there's too little light or the sensor is covered.
-   Manage expectations. Suggest alternative actions if something is
    impossible.

Outputs are a design medium.

### Inputs

-   Calibration



-   User provides essential information to make the feature work.
-   Be quick and effortless, only ask for essential information
-   Introduce, guide and confirm
-   Provide a way to update/remove the information



-   Implicit feedback



-   Improve the model based on interactions with the app.
-   Strive to identify people's intention
-   Accuracy over speed
-   Respect people's privacy
-   Make interactions more accurate and delightful



-   Explicit feedback



-   Prioritize negative feedback over positive.
-   Love/dislike? Clearly describe the action and its consequences.
    Provide different options to better understand the user's intention.



-   Corrections



-   Detect when the user fixes a mistake and update the model.
-   Use known tasks for this. For example, with spelling, the standard
    text editing is recognized and used.
-   Example: cropping in photos suggests a crop and allows the user to
    tweak it.

When we align the way we create with the values we uphold we can create
great experiences.
