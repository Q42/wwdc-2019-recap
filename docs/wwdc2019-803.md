Very high level talk about ML experiences, good watch for customers wanting to use ML.
Good watch for Interaction Designers.

-   > "Design more than just the interface"
-   Outputs: multiple options (all results from confidence list result),
    attributes (how does the app decide?), confidence (how sure?),
    limitations
-   State real facts in attributions "Top Picks, because you love
    cooking" =\> "Top Picks, because you downloaded NY Cooking"
-   Convert confidence levels into easy to understand information /
    actions.
-   Use 'ranges' for confidence effect (you'll arrive between
    13:10-13:20)
-   Coaching tips like with Animoji: "Low Light", "Camera Covered"
-   Limitation with alternatives in macOS: "Set a timer for 20 minutes."
    "Sorry, can't set a timer, how about a reminder?"
-   BasketBall ML app uses neat calibration setup: auto detects basket &
    starts keeping the score
-   Implicit Feedback, used in for example Siri Suggestions
-   Explicit Feedback: buttons like/dislike are unclear what action will
    follow. "Show less from this Author" is more specific.
-   Corrections: fixing mistake, example in Keyboard. When you type a
    name, correct the suggestion, then the Keyboard learns
-   In Photos app, the auto-correct rotation & crop result will only be
    the starting point of your action. You can then tweak it.
