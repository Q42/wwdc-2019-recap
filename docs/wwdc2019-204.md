The SwiftUI view data structure gets compressed aggressively. So using
small views to abstract things is fine and is encouraged.

Properties of views are either a source of truth (@State, @Binding) or
derived from a source of truth (var, let).

There's live mode vs. Preview mode. Preview mode lets you inspect
components, tweak them and drag new ones in. Live mode runs the app as
if it were in the simulator so you can interact with it.

You need the macOS Catalina beta to use previews at all.

### State properties

In for example UIKit, the number of states and event orderings in your
views makes for a combinatorial explosion of different states. SwiftUI
tries to remedy this problem. SwiftUI scales with your brain, virtually
eliminating UI inconsistencies.
