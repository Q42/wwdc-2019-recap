Programming takes craft, care & ingenuity. 👩🏼‍💻 Build good habits to
stay on track. Compare it to habits you've built for driving your car.
You automatically take care of many things without even realizing it.

### Organize

Clean (virtual) workspace

-   Organize functionally using groups that match the folder structure
    on disk
-   Storyboard references
-   Modernize your project file
-   File \> Project settings \> New build system

### Track

Use git.

### Document

Write clear commit messages. Write useful comments.

### Test

Use unit tests for code that you could forget (example:
serializing/deserializing), and is not covered by the type system. Use
them to test for regressions.

### Analyze

-   Use the network link conditioner
-   Use the address sanitizer to check for buffer overflows
-   Use thread sanitizer to check for race conditions
-   Use the undefined behavior sanitizer

### Evaluate

Use code review.

### Decouple

Split code up into packages/libraries/frameworks.
