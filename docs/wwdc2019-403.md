### Selecting languages

New iOS/macOS setting: change the language per app, independent of the
system language

        This means you no longer need a language picker inside the app

        You can create a button that launches into settings

        Use state restoration because the app gets relaunched

### Workflow

The xcodebuild command can be used to import/export localizations
automatically or in your scripts.

You can use a stringsdict for strings that vary by device class
(example: tap here on iPhone/iPad vs. click here on a Mac).

### Asset localization

Images and symbol sets (new) can be localized right in the asset
catalog, just press the 'Localize' button!

### Localized screenshots with XCTest

Xcode now supports test plans, this lets you run tests for multiple
different configurations at once.

        Use accessibility identifiers to have your UI tests be
independent of the current language.

        Settings for localization screenshots are under: UI Testing -\>
Localization screenshots -\> On

Q: Is it useful to create a test suite just for taking app store
screenshots? These tests will just navigate through the right screens in
the app but not assert anything.
