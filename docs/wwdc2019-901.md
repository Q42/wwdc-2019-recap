1.   Bluetooth hardware/software:
    -   BR/EDR devices ('classic devices') support was missing in
        CoreBluetooth, until now: this means CoreBluetooth can now talk to
        Ã¡ll accessories, cars, etc.
    -   Physical layer rate goes from 1Mbps to 2Mbps with Bluetooth 5.0,
        (available in iPhone 8+)
    -   Advertising Extensions means a larger advertisement payload can be
        send (after smaller packet first)
    -   Extended Connections: wakes up the host processor only AFTER a BLE
        connection handshake; requires support in accessory; less battery
        drain
    -   Core Bluetooth abstracts over BR/EDR & BLE differences (BR/EDR
        doesn't have GATT traditionally)
    -   Connection Event, send on matching connections!
    -   Dual-Mode Pairing: cross transport key derivation (BE 4.2 SIG spec),
        same CBPeripheral, but both BLE and classic transport.
    -   Any LE connection can also be BR/EDR connected by iOS 13, etc (add
        option in CB options).

2.   Privacy:
    -   Bluetooth access must be actively authorized for your app
    -   Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS), a GATT server service so
        your accessory can show your iOS notifications
    -   "Share System Notifications" permission is required for ANCS

3.   Developer tools:
    -   CB PacketLogger packet analysis application, visualizer. Decodes all
        SIG & Apple protocols
    -   Live Capture: view packets between iOS \<=\> accessory on
        PacketLogger running on Mac.
    -   Requires "iOS Bluetooth developer logging profile", app part of
        "Additional Tools for Xcode"

Preliminary questions:
    -   Sending Heart Rate to other devices from Watch
    -   Overwrite outgoing message buffer?

Went to subsequent Core Bluetooth lab:
-   Can an Extended Runtime Watch application act as a Peripheral to a
    Central accessory and send Heart Rate information?
    > Contact information recorded, will contact
-   Overwrite outgoing message buffer?
    > Instead of using data packets, use advertisement data. That emits only the last state.
