The current state of the art: you have to create a UITableViewDataSource
and tell the tableViewController about updates yourself. This often goes
wrong, causing crashes (incorrect row count).

Introducing: Diffable data source. (UITableViewDiffableDataSource,
UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource)

Initialize this class with a closure that returns your cells. The
closure works similar to cellForRowAtIndexPath.

Differences in the data are calculated and animated automatically when
you call .apply()

        Nb: Data items need to conform to hashable

Performance is currently good, and will improve in the future. But
diffing is a linear operation, O(n) complexity. You can call apply()
from the background queue.

Oh, and it's a Swift only API!
