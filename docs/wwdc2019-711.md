Talk in 2 parts. Foundation in first, Combine second.

Foundation, by I-Ting Tina Liu

-   Ordered Collection Diffing: `Sequence.difference(from:)` generates
    diff, `Sequence.applying(diff:)` performs patch
-   ContiguousBytes protocol, means data is available as contiguous
    bytes in memory
-   Data.compressed(using:), with 4 algorithms
-   RelativeDateTimeFormatter (2 weeks ago)
-   ListFormatter.localizedString(byJoining:)
-   OperationQueue, barriers & progress counting

Combine, by Tony Parker

-   A unified, declaraive API for processing values over time
-   Request driven, vs Event driven
-   Publishers/Subscribers/Operators
-   Publishers are value type
-   extension: `NotificationCenter.Publisher(center: NotificationCenter, name: Notification.Name, object: Any? = nil)`
-   `Subscribers.Assign`
-   `.receive(subscription:)`, `.request(demand:)`, `.receive(value:)`
-   Operators are also value types
-   Example operator: Publishers.Map
-   Declarative Operator API: functional, lists, error, threads, time

### What's new

#### Diffing

ContiguousBytes

let compressed = try data.compressed(using: .lzfse)

Unit conversions, new units

RelativeDateTimeFormatter

#### OperationQueue

Has a high level API for doing work in sequence, and it now support
progress indication.

#### Combine

A unified declarative api for processing values over time

##### Combine key concepts

Publishers

        Defines how values and errors are produced

        Is a value type

        Allows for registration of a subscriber

        Example: \`NotificationCenter.Publisher\` publisher

Subscribers

        Counterpart to publisher

        Receives values and a completion

        Is a reference type

        Example: \`Subscribers.Assign\` is a keypath subscriber

Operator

        Returns a new publisher

        Changes values
