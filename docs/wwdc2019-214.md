Instead of hardcoded colours, use semantic colours.

Primary, secondary tertiary backgrounds and more are provided by apple.
They already made a design system that you can adopt. But you can define
your own colors using an asset catalog.

Other than colors, there are materials, consisting of translucency on
top of a background.

        New materials (blur effects) are in the SDK

Implementing dark mode:

        Specify dark mode background colors and images in your asset
catalog.

Resolving colours yourself

Resolve dynamic colours in layoutSubviews()

Listen to traitcollectiondidchange/tintcolordidchange for changes

You can always safely set the current trait collection, even on a
background thread. If you do so, be consistent on which thread you do
it.

### Trait collections

There is not always one single trait collection in the app

The trait collection cascades downwards from

UIScreen -\> UIWindowScene -\> UIWindow -\> UIPresentationController -\>
UIViewController -\> UIView

Traits are predicted during UIView initialisation

You can override the traitcollection for a viewcontroller/view using the
property:

        overrideUserInterfaceStyle

        Q: so this does cascade downwards?
