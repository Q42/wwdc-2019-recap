Xcode now has Swift package manager integration, so you can use packages
in your apps.

UI improvements: you can add split views like in other editors. You can
use the canvas preview with SwiftUI.

SF symbols are added, your own custom symbols are also possible, use an
asset catalog.

Assets in asset catalogs can now be Localized!

You can have asset colours and images vary for light/dark mode.

Use the environment overrides button (in the debugger bar) to test dark
mode and accessibility.

### Conditions

Xcode now supports test plans. You can run tests for many different
states/configurations in one go.

### Instruments

Now has hierarchical tracks.

You can use os.signpostÂ to surface your own data in the debugger. For
example: measuring your networking code or JSON decoding (PostNL).

Use UIViewRepresentable to use SwiftUI views in your existing UIKit
apps.
