Xcode now has SPM integration, yada yada. Boooooring.

If you document your sources using Swiftdoc comments, these docs will be
visible in the generated interface.

The xcshareddata directory contains the version lock, so don't forget to
check it in.

You can only have one version of a package in a workspace at a time.

        It can cause resolution errors if your version requirements
differ in the graph.
