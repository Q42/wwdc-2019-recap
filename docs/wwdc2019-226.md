-   Property, BindableObject, `@Environment`, `@Binding`, `@State`
-   "\@State is the source of truth"
-   "Views are a function of state, not of a sequence of events"
-   `$`-prefix derives a `@Binding` from a `@State`
-   `withAnimation` wraps action that triggers recompute
-   Must publish on main thread, use `.receive(on:)`
-   BindableObject for external data, is a reference type, for existing
    models
    -   Protocol has `didChange` property which must be a
        Publisher/Subject
    -   Call .send on subject when updating the data
-   \@ObjectBinding var model: `<BindableObject conform>`
-   \@EnvironmentObject var model: `<BindableObject conform>`
-   Environment is indirectly passed through the view hierarchy
    -   Used by accent color, text direction, dynamic type, Dark Mode  & Forms
-   Example when to use `@State`: Button tracking the highlight state

````
onReceive(<publisher>) { newCurrentTime in
Â  self.currentTime = newCurrentTime
}
```
