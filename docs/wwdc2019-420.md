-   [TuriCreate](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) gains two new tasks:
    1. One-Shot Object Detection task
    2. Drawing Classification task
-   Instead of having multiple images of the same class, One-Shot will
    automatically augment a set of pictures with your classes single
    training image
-   Demo given in Jupiter notebook
-   `turicreate.load\_images("./")` loads all files in directory
-   `SFrame` is a container for all your data
-   `turicreate.on_shot_object_detector.create(sframe, 'label')` trains
    & creates the ML model
-   Super easy way to create a model for image recognition!!
-   New input: Apple Pencil
-   Build Drawing Classification model from SVG or images, and results
    in \<500kB on-device model for detecting Apple Pencil drawings

Remarks:
-   Watch this video as a good primer, if you want to create an image
    recognition app!
-   Very handy "Interactive Visualisation / Verification Explorer" which
    visualizes the results of the model training & verification
